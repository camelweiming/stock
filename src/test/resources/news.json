    "title": "Momentum a Powerful Ally for Stocks as Whiplash Rally Rolls On",
    "content": "(Bloomberg) -- There are many reasons to doubt the rebound in US stocks, but it has at least one powerful factor on its side: momentum.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThe Battle Over the Fate of Detroit\u2019s Renaissance Center NYC Real Estate Industry Asks Judge to Block New Broker Fee Law NJ Transit Strike Would Be \u2018Disaster\u2019 for Region, Sherrill Says NJ Transit Urges Commuters to Work Remotely If Union Strikes Iceland Plans for a More Volcanic Future\n\nHistory shows that the rally may extend further than investors might expect and bode well for stock performance down the road. Though it\u2019s not infallible, that trend is good news for traders betting that stocks might have more room to run following a dismal start to the year.\n\nThe bounce in the S&P 500 Index has already been one for the record books. The benchmark index notched its ninth-straight daily gain on Friday, the longest stretch since 2004. Such streaks have tended to precede further upside: The S&P 500 was a median 20% higher a year after moves of similar magnitude while notching gains in shorter-term periods along the way, according to WisdomTree\u2019s Jeff Weniger, who analyzed data going back to the late 1980s.\n\n\u201cYour gut says \u2018Maybe this is too much, maybe take some chips off the table,\u2019\u201d said Weniger, the firm\u2019s head of equities. \u201cBut in actuality, this often times tends to beget more in the way of the rally.\u201d\n\nAnalysts have pointed to a variety of factors driving the gains. Markets have cheered signs that the US is seeking to eventually ease tariffs on China and reach trade deals with other countries. Stronger-than-expected jobs data on Friday also buoyed optimism, along with solid earnings from a quartet of Big Tech companies last week.\n\nMarket observers also say that fund managers are fearful of missing out on more upside and some are now raising their exposure to equities, further stoking the upward momentum. The S&P 500 is just 8% away from its Feb. 19 record high, rebounding from a loss of nearly 20% last month.\n\nTechnical analysts have also noted that the benchmark is back above its 50-day moving average, a closely-watched indicator of short-term support, for the first time since the week it hit its last record.\n\nAnother important factor is the reawakening of the so-called Magnificent Seven technology giants, whose shares are key drivers of the S&P 500 due to their heavy weightings in the index. Earnings for Meta Platforms Inc. and Microsoft Corp. were stronger than expected last week, allowing investors to shrug off less favorable results from Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. A Bloomberg index of Magnificent Seven stocks has surged 19% since the April 8th bottom.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe cohort \u201cmay be the only growth story in town and now they\u2019re trading at valuations I would say are cheap,\u201d said David Wagner, portfolio manager at Aptus Capital Advisors LLC.\n\nPlenty of investors are hesitant to jump aboard the rally, especially with little clarity on how the trade war could shake out and its eventual toll on the economy. Actual progress on negotiations with China remains remains scant. Trade frictions with other countries could also flare once the pause on levies expires in July.\n\n\u201cIt is a big stretch to think that initial high level talks between the US and China means that outlook for the US economy should return to its pre-Liberation Day levels,\u201d Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak + Co. \u201cThe tariff issue is still going to create some real headwinds for the economy.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, recent stock moves echo past periods of sustained gains, rather than short-lived bear market rallies.\n\nThe S&P 500 has posted an average daily move of 1.8% since April 8. Much bigger swings, which occurred during periods of market stress such as the Covid-19 shock and the 2009 financial crisis, have been absent.\n\nThat\u2019s a positive sign, as daily moves of over 3% tend to coalesce around periods of market distress, according to a report from Nathaniel Welnhofer, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.\n\n\u201cSlow-and-steady gains in S&P 500 stocks should be celebrated,\u201d he said.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nMade-in-USA Wheelbarrows Promoted by Trump Are Now Made in China 100 Moments You Might Have Missed From Trump\u2019s First 100 Days How an Israeli Hostage Negotiator Outsmarts Ransomware Hackers Can the Labubu Doll Craze Survive Trump\u2019s Tariffs?

    "content": "What began quietly years ago has grown into a defining long-term play for Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK) (NYSE:BRK), as the company signals no intention of slowing down or reassessing its $20 billion bet on Japanese trading companies, amid a changing macro climate.\n\nWhat Happened: On Saturday, during Berkshire\u2019s annual shareholder meeting, Warren Buffett addressed a question from the audience regarding the company's investments in Japan and his outlook on the same in light of a potential interest rate hike by the Bank of Japan.\n\nBuffett said he was unfazed by the macro backdrop, stating, \u201cI'll let the people of Japan determine their best course of action in terms of economics.\u201d\n\nHe then went on to reaffirm his confidence in the five Japanese trading companies, Mitsubishi (OTC:MSBHF), Marubeni (OTC:MARUY), Mitsui (OTC:MITSY), Sumitomo (NYSE:SMFG) and Itouchi (OTC:ITOCY), while expressing continued optimism about both their prospects and the broader Japanese economy.\n\nSee More: Warren Buffett Shares Surprising Advice for Young Investors\u2014And It\u2019s Not About Stocks: \u2018Who You Associate With Is Just Enormously Important\u2019\n\nBuffett noted that when he first acquired stakes in these trading houses six years ago, they were \u201cselling at ridiculously low prices.\u201d His conviction deepened over time, he added, as he got to know the companies and their leadership teams better.\n\n\u201cJapan's record has been extraordinary,\u201d he said, pointing to the strong presence of several major American companies in the region, including several Berkshire holdings like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Coca-Cola Co. (NYSE:KO), and American Express Co. (NYSE:AXP).\n\nBuffett added that \u201cin the next 50 years, we won't give a thought to selling those [Japanese trading houses] positions,\u201d underscoring not only his own long-term conviction but also that of Berkshire Vice Chairman, and his newly appointed successor, Greg Abel.\n\nAbel followed up by saying, \u201cIt's been a very good investment, but we really envision holding the investment for 50 years or forever,\u201d adding that he hopes to \u201cdo big things with them globally.\u201d\n\nWhy It Matters: Early last month, Berkshire was preparing another round of yen-denominated bond issuance, reportedly aimed at refinancing maturing debt and increasing its stakes in its Japanese plays.\n\nFormer Vice Chairman Charlie Munger had described the investment as a \u201cno-brainer,\u201d pointing to Japan's ultra-low borrowing rates, around 0.50%, and the attractive dividend yields of over 5% offered by the trading houses.\n\nThe company reported its first-quarter results on Saturday, with operating earnings falling 14% year-over-year to $9.6 billion. The decline was primarily due to a $1.1 billion hit to underwriting profits from wildfires in Southern California during the quarter.\n\nStory Continues\n\nPrice Action: Berkshire shares were up 1.80% on Friday, and are up 0.35% after hours following the company\u2019s first quarter results, according to data from Benzinga Pro.\n\nRead More:\n\n\u2018Curtain Call For The Captain:\u2019 Tim Cook, Bill Gates, Mark Cuban And Other Top Business Leaders React As Warren Buffett Bows Out\n\nImage Via Shutterstock\n\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

    "title": "Was Jim Cramer Right About Apple (AAPL)?",
    "content": "We recently published a list of Did Jim Cramer Hit or Miss On These 13 Stock Predictions? In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discussed during the episode of Mad Money on May 1st, 2024.\n\nDuring the Mad Money episode which aired on Tuesday, Jim Cramer discussed how stock ownership is viewed in the United States, saying:\n\n\u201cAlright, look, lately, we can\u2019t go a day without hearing some widespread misperceptions about stock ownership. I gotta tell you, I think it\u2019s infuriating. Here we are celebrating the 20th anniversary of Mad Money, dedicated to the proposition that you can potentially make lots of money by picking individual stocks, yet I keep hearing that most Americans don\u2019t care about the stock market, and this direction means nothing.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO:  How Did Jim Cramer\u2019s 12 Bold Predictions Play Out? and Did Jim Cramer Nail All These 9 Stock Predictions?\n\nJim Cramer challenged the idea that the stock market only serves the wealthy, calling it a flawed and dismissive perspective that overlooks the financial involvement of millions of ordinary Americans, saying:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the whole reason anyone watches the darn show, and it generally matters, not just to the rich, but to tens of millions of regular people, home gamers, and never let any politician tell you otherwise. [\u2026] More than 60% of Americans have some exposure to the market, either directly or indirectly. 70 million people have active 401Ks. Millions more have retired with them. 60 million people have IRAs. Only 156 million people voted in November. I mean, we\u2019re talking half the electorate here.\u201d\n\nCramer argued that stockholders make up a major segment of the population and should not be ignored. He stated, \u201cIt\u2019s not just arrogant, rich people who own stocks.\u201d He also criticized affluent individuals who caution others against investing in stocks while continuing to benefit from their tax advantages. As he put it:\n\n\u201cNow look, stocks are ridiculously tax advantaged, more than just rich people want that. In a world where probably no more than 10% of this country can retire on their paycheck savings, stocks represent a different kind of social security, a one-sided pack where people try to save and the government dismisses them.\u201d\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 13 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on May 1st, 2024. We then calculated their performance from May 1st, 2024, market close to April 30th, 2025, market close. We have also included the hedge fund sentiment for the stocks, which we sourced from Insider Monkey\u2019s Q4 2024 database of over 900 hedge funds. The stocks are listed in the order that Cramer mentioned them.\n\nStory Continues\n\nPlease note that this article mentions Jim Cramer\u2019s previous opinions and may not account for any changes to his opinions regarding the stocks that are mentioned. It is primarily an examination of how his previously provided opinions have panned out.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).Was Jim Cramer Right About Apple Inc. (AAPL)?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 166\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), the giant iPhone maker, was discussed toward the end of that older episode as Cramer warned about China weakness potentially impacting the company\u2019s quarterly results. Here\u2019s what Jim Cramer said at the time:\n\n\u201cDo you want to dodge a quarter? You want to dodge it, be my guest. I\u2019m never good enough to know when to get in and get out, so I\u2019m sticking.\u201d\n\nDespite the challenges, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has remained resilient over the past year and its stock is up 25.39%.\n\nMaking Jim Cramer\u2019s recent list of the best stocks in the last twenty years, he said the following:\n\n\u201cFourth place: Apple, up more than 14,500% since we went on air. The great thing about Apple is these gains were totally gettable, come on. This was the most obvious story in America for years and years. It\u2019s much harder to own here because it\u2019s under fire from the White House for sourcing most of its merchandise from China for the cell phones. But it\u2019s still a terrific illustration of the fact that you don\u2019t need to be a genius to pick winners in this business.\u201d\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 7th on our list of stocks that Jim Cramer discussed during the episode of Mad Money on May 1st, 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about this cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and 30 Best Stocks to Buy Now According to Billionaires.\n\nDisclosure: None.

    "title": "Big Tech Earnings Defy Fears of \u2018Worst-Case Scenario\u2019 for Stocks",
    "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Investors in the US technology behemoths that dominate the S&P 500 Index are breathing a sigh of relief as last week\u2019s earnings reports from the group show their outlooks remain mostly strong in the face of President Donald Trump\u2019s shifting trade policies.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThe Battle Over the Fate of Detroit\u2019s Renaissance Center NYC Lost $9 Billion of Income to Miami, Palm Beach in Five Years NYC Real Estate Industry Asks Judge to Block New Broker Fee Law NJ Transit Urges Commuters to Work Remotely If Union Strikes NJ Transit Strike Would Be \u2018Disaster\u2019 for Region, Sherrill Says\n\nOne after another, tech giants from Amazon.com Inc. to Microsoft Corp. unveiled forecasts that suggest demand remains largely intact for businesses including electronic devices, cloud computing services, software and digital advertising. While the reports were by no means perfect \u2014 Apple Inc. was a high-profile disappointment \u2014 they eased many of the worst-case fears that the firms would signal a tariff-induced profit slump was on the immediate horizon.\n\nIt was an encouraging stretch for investors seeking signs that the stock market\u2019s rebound potentially has legs. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index took its two-week rally to 10% and is now almost 3% above where it closed on April 2, before Trump unleashed tariffs on virtually all of America\u2019s largest trade partners. Microsoft led gains in the so-called Magnificent Seven megacaps, with its best week in more than two years.\n\n\u201cA lot of investors were braced to hear things that were very grim,\u201d said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott. \u201cEven numbers that were a little weak were far from the worst-case scenario. That\u2019s allowing the market to take a glass-half-full view, even though the situation remains foggy, and the rebound could be jeopardized by any emerging signs of a slowdown.\u201d\n\nOf course, the threat of renewed volatility hangs over the tech giants as the trade war drags on. It will also take until the next earnings cycle to see how the sector actually performed once Trump\u2019s levies took effect. Until the picture is clearer, Luschini said he\u2019s avoiding big sector bets and holding defensive shares, along with tech stocks linked to long-term growth trends.\n\nBig Tech companies have been at the center of the selloff in US stocks that\u2019s shaved about 3% off of the S&P 500 this year as traders pocketed profits on the cohort and shifted into defensive assets. The worry is that tariffs will fan inflation and stifle economic growth. The market got some reassurance on Friday from a strong jobs report, as well as hints of possible trade talks between the US and China.\n\nStory Continues\n\nStill, the underlying uncertainty has caused companies including airlines, shoemakers and retailers to withdraw forecasts and take a cautious approach to spending. Most of the tech giants bucked that trend.\n\nOf the six Magnificent Seven companies that have reported, four gave revenue forecasts that were either roughly in line or exceeded Wall Street estimates. Google parent Alphabet Inc. kept with tradition and didn\u2019t provide one. Nvidia Corp., the last to report, is scheduled to announce results on May 28.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s revenue forecasts for the current quarter topped expectations thanks in part to strength in its Azure cloud-computing business, where demand continues to outstrip its data center capacity. Amazon\u2019s operating profit outlook was weaker than expected, but Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy said it hasn\u2019t \u201cseen any attenuation of demand yet.\u201d Meta offered reassurance about the outlook for digital ad-spending with a forecast that was roughly in-line with analyst estimates.\n\nSpending Leeway\n\nThe earnings season has also calmed worries about capital spending on artificial-intelligence computing gear, which has fueled a revenue boom for companies like Nvidia and Broadcom Inc. Meta raised its forecast for capital expenditures this year, and Microsoft said growth in such outlays would slow next year but still rise.\n\nThe comments sent shares of chipmakers and computing-hardware makers higher.\n\n\u201cTech companies are getting more leeway to spend, because they\u2019ve shown it can deliver returns and support growth,\u201d said Hanna Howard, a portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t all good news, however. Tesla Inc. backed away from a prior forecast to return to revenue growth in 2025, and Apple said it expects $900 million in higher costs from tariffs in the current quarter. The iPhone maker was hit with at least two Wall Street downgrades, with the analysts citing tariff headwinds and growth concerns.\n\nWhile profit estimates in many S&P 500 sectors have fallen this earnings season, projections for tech giants are climbing. According to Bloomberg Intelligence, earnings for the Magnificent Seven are seen rising 21.6% in 2025, while revenue is expected to grow 9.7%. Both estimates have risen in the past week.\n\n\u201cThere was a lot of concern that we\u2019d see a more drastic pullback, but based on what we\u2019ve seen, things look much better than expected,\u201d Gabelli\u2019s Howard said. \u201cThere\u2019s certainly a concern that things could get worse, but for the most part it has been pretty positive.\u201d\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nMade-in-USA Wheelbarrows Promoted by Trump Are Now Made in China How an Israeli Hostage Negotiator Outsmarts Ransomware Hackers 100 Moments You Might Have Missed From Trump\u2019s First 100 Days Can the Labubu Doll Craze Survive Trump\u2019s Tariffs?

    "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\n99% of the time I have a good sense of the economy ahead of an action-packed gathering like the Milken conference.\n\nHeld each May, the unique conference brings together a wealth of characters ranging from NBA legend Magic Johnson to investing maven Ken Griffin.\n\nYou can just feel the money in the room.\n\nUnlike recent Milken conferences, this year\u2019s event will have a heavy showing from the White House \u2014 with a few sideshows, of course.\n\nThe two headliners on this front: Tesla (TSLA) CEO and DOGE master Elon Musk (who appeared last year) and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang was just added to the speaker list late this week.\n\nMedia titan Rupert Murdoch is also expected to make a rare appearance amongst the various Trump administration folks walking the halls.\n\nI once again have a bunch of really cool live interviews teed up, along with a few Opening Bid podcasts. So be sure to tune into Yahoo Finance Monday morning!\n\nSee more from the Opening Bid podcast\n\nWhy the bond market may not be in a crisis This is the new investing portfolio for the next 10 years How to invest in Nvidia successfully during Trump tariff turmoil\n\nBack to the economy.\n\nThere's more going on with the economy than the 0.3% GDP drop that momentarily hit stocks this week. It's just not that simple. Tariffs are hurting a lot of companies (including Apple (AAPL) to the tune of $900 million in extra costs, we learned this week). But it's not hurting others, as conventional wisdom would hold.\n\nPut it all together, and you have a very confusing investing backdrop.\n\nThe best thing I can do is present what the world's top leaders are seeing and hearing. From there, you make your own judgment on where the economy may be headed \u2014 because, honestly, I'm not sure, and I suspect that confusion will be on display in my chats this week at Milken.\n\nHere's what CEOs have told me in the last week on Trump tariffs, markets, and the US economy.\n\nCoca-Cola (KO) chairman & CEO James Quincey\n\nFull interview\n\n\"If you look at the US business, the weakness in volume in Q1 was concentrated in what we call future consumption packaging, which is much more predominant in supermarkets or ... independent trade outlets, rather than either convenience or the away-from-home quick-serve restaurants and all the away-from-home channels. So that's where the weakness was focused, which I think is partly an indication of some of the affordability pressure for the lower-income consumer and some of the geopolitical reaction.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nStarbucks (SBUX) chairman & CEO Brian Niccol\n\nFull interview\n\n\"If you look at our results, what I'm seeing actually is a step up in transactions as it relates to our business in the US. We had our best quarter as it relates to sales comps in the last five quarters. And so, we continue to see progress in the Starbucks business with customers.\"\n\n\"We're not seeing a change in the basket [size]. So when they come in, the attach [rate] has been pretty much the same as far as customization or adding on food.\"A Starbucks coffee logo is displayed outside one of their stores on March 23, 2025 in San Diego, California. (Photo by Kevin Carter\/Getty Images)\u00b7Kevin Carter via Getty Images\n\nVisa (V) CEO Ryan McInerney\n\nFull interview\n\n\"We saw strong, broad-based consumer spending [in the quarter]. We definitely saw some deceleration in certain parts of the economy, but also strong spending growth in other parts of the economy.\n\n\"What we can add is a view in a broad-based way across a significant portion of Americans and almost all the categories in which they spend. And, you know, for the last three months or so, including the first three or four weeks of April, we've seen strong spending growth.\"\n\nCharles Schwab (SCHW) CEO Rick Wurster\n\nFull interview\n\n\"In general, we have seen some net equity selling and we have seen sentiment among our clients become a little bit more bearish. So in general, as a group, among our 45 million clients, there has been a little bit more concern. Now, within that, we have seen some of our longer-term-oriented investors and some of our more active traders get invested. I was just in Ann Arbor in one of our branches, and I said, 'How are clients doing?' And they were telling me our younger investors, many of them haven't seen a pullback like this. And so ... our youngest investors are some of the ones calling us where they've never called us before.\"\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

    "content": "Investing.com -- Here is your Pro Recap of the top takeaways from Wall Street analysts for the past week.\n\nInvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analyst comments. Upgrade today!\n\nPeloton\n\nWhat happened? On Monday, Truist upgraded  Peloton Interactive Inc  (NASDAQ:PTON) to Buy with a $11 price target.\n\n*TLDR: Peloton\u2019s fundamentals improve; equity recovery begins. Attractive valuation presents long-term opportunity.\n\nWhat\u2019s the full story? Truist sees Peloton\u2019s stock approaching a point where improving fundamentals can drive a gradual equity recovery. With the balance sheet strengthened and operating expenses significantly reduced, the company is now positioned for sustained free cash flow profitability. Under new leadership, Truist believes the focus has shifted to revenue growth, which is expected to materialize by FY26. Subscriptions, already accounting for roughly two-thirds of revenue, are contributing to expanding profitability and margins.\n\nAt current valuations\u20141.4x sales and 10.3x AEBITDA\u2014the stock appears largely de-risked, offering a compelling entry point for long-term investors.\n\nThe analyst team anticipates Peloton\u2019s F3Q25 results, due May 8, to reflect revenue slightly above consensus estimates, based on proprietary card data. While near-term challenges remain, the combination of cleaner financials, leaner operations, and a strategic focus on growth suggests Peloton is on a path to sustainable value creation.\n\nTruist views the current valuation as an opportunity for patient investors to capitalize on the company\u2019s evolving turnaround.\n\nHims & Hers Health\n\nWhat happened? On Tuesday, TD Cowen downgraded Hims Hers Health Inc (NYSE:HIMS) to Hold with a $30 price target.\n\n*TLDR: HIMS faces growth challenges post-1Q25. Competitive pressures, uncertain outlook persist.\n\nWhat\u2019s the full story? TD Cowen sees challenges ahead for HIMS in 2025. Following a strong 1Q25 EPS, growth could stall as compounded GLP-1s are no longer offered after May 22. Management\u2019s $725 million weight loss revenue target may prove optimistic if users don\u2019t switch to alternatives like Liraglutide or oral medications, or if they gravitate toward competitors like Lilly Direct and NovoCare.\n\nThe intensifying competitive landscape, coupled with a softer consumer environment, adds pressure, particularly for HIMS\u2019 higher-priced, cash-pay offerings, despite FSA\/HSA acceptance for weight loss.\n\nThe analysts expect 1Q25 EPS upside but note a potential short squeeze given 34% short interest. However, adjusted earnings forecasts for FY25 and FY26 may decline, posing downside risk. While HIMS remains uniquely positioned to personalize and democratize healthcare with its scalable, trusted platform, near-term catalysts are scarce. Weight loss specialty progress post-GLP-1 availability will influence FY26 estimates.\n\nStory Continues\n\nTD Cowen lowers the price target to $30, reflecting ~2.6x FY26 EV\/Sales, as the path forward grows uncertain.\n\nAirbnb\n\nWhat happened? On Wednesday, DA Davidson upgraded  Airbnb Inc  (NASDAQ:ABNB) to Buy with a $155 price target.\n\n*TLDR: Online travel spend stays resilient. Airbnb undervalued, poised for growth.\n\nWhat\u2019s the full story? DA Davidson highlights the resilience of online leisure travel spend, noting that while broader economic slowdowns could impact the sector, the largest OTAs like Booking (NASDAQ:BKNG) and  Expedia  (NASDAQ:EXPE) are likely to outperform due to increasing global adoption of online lodging and alternative accommodations. The brokerage points out that these players grew gross bookings annually even during the Great Financial Crisis, albeit with modest help from M&A. Airbnb, as the leader in alternative accommodations with over eight million listings globally, benefits from its expansive inventory and affordability initiatives, which have kept pricing flat or down compared to rising hotel rates.\n\nThe brokerage emphasizes Airbnb\u2019s ongoing tech stack development, setting the stage for new product launches that could drive asset-light revenue streams. While specifics remain under wraps, features like the re-launched Experiences and the upcoming May 2025 \u201cSummer Release\u201d are expected to boost 2026 estimates.\n\nAdditionally, Airbnb\u2019s valuation appears reasonable, trading at a 16.5x 2025 EV\/EBITDA, a 14% discount to its one-year average and a 30% discount since January 2022. DA Davidson adds Airbnb to its Best-of-Breed Bison initiative, citing its enduring competitive moat, category-leading margins, strong cash flows, and shares trading at a meaningful discount to long-term intrinsic value\n\nWestern Digital  Corp.\n\nWhat happened? On Thursday, JPMorgan launched coverage on Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC) at Overweight with a $57 price target.\n\n*TLDR: WDC transitions to HDD, outperforms expectations. Strong margins, growth ahead.\n\nWhat\u2019s the full story? JPMorgan notes Western Digital\u2019s successful transition to a pure-play HDD provider following its NAND business separation in February. The company delivered strong March-quarter results, surpassing consensus on revenue, margins, and EPS, driven by robust demand from cloud and hyperscale customers. For the June quarter, WDC forecasts $2.45 billion in revenue, up 7% sequentially, while cautiously navigating potential tariff-related headwinds.\n\nAccelerating shipments of its 26TB and 32TB drives, alongside progress on next-gen HAMR solutions, position WDC for sustained growth, with volume shipments expected in early 2027.\n\nThe investment bank highlights WDC\u2019s strong exabyte demand, supported by long-term agreements with hyperscalers extending into mid-2026. Gross margins, guided at 40.5%, are expected to expand further due to favorable pricing and a tight supply environment.\n\nWDC is also strengthening its balance sheet, redeeming $1.8 billion in senior notes and initiating a $0.10 quarterly dividend.\n\nApple\n\nWhat happened? On Friday, Rosenblatt downgraded Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) to Neutral with a $217 price target.\n\n*TLDR: Apple downgraded; growth muted, lacks spark. Enjoy show, tread carefully.\n\nWhat\u2019s the full story? Rosenblatt downgrades Apple to Neutral, slashing the price target to $217. Sure, F2Q25 showed Cupertino\u2019s mastery of supply chain voodoo and iPhone demand that didn\u2019t tank as feared. But let\u2019s be real: for this stock to pop, AI needs to kick iPhone sales into hyperdrive. And let\u2019s just say, that narrative is looking more like a damp squib than a fireworks show.\n\nSo here we are: a finely tuned machine chugging along with muted growth, desperately in need of the next shiny object to wow the masses. All while trading at a premium multiple in a world of tariffs, regulatory chaos, and geopolitical circus acts. Apple\u2019s still Apple\u2014just not the rockstar it used to be. The analysts\u2019 message? Enjoy the show, but don\u2019t bet the farm.\n\nRelated articles\n\nStreet Calls of the Week\n\nEnd of an Era: Buffett to step down as Berkshire CEO\n\nBuffett\u2019s Berkshire sells more stocks, cash pile swells to record $347.7 billion\n\nView Comments",

    "content": "Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nBillionaire Warren Buffett has a long history of his Berkshire Hathaway Inc (NYSE:BRK)(NYSE:BRK) conglomerate outperforming the S&P 500, which is tracked by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY).\n\nWhile many stocks are down in 2025, one of Buffett's top holdings is significantly outperforming the broader market and could help him outperform in 2025 once again.\n\nWhat Happened: Buffett's investment in Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), which remains his largest stock position in Berkshire Hathaway, has helped produce strong returns but is turning into a sore spot in 2025.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nMaker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing \u2014 you can become an investor for $0.80 per share today. Maximize saving for your retirement and cut down on taxes: Schedule your free call with a financial advisor to start your financial journey \u2013 no cost, no obligation.\n\nApple stock is down 15.9% year-to-date in 2025. In fact, of the five largest stock holdings in Berkshire Hathaway, only one is positive year-to-date as shown below:\n\nApple Inc: -15.9% American Express (NYSE:AXP): -7.1% Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO): +15.3% Bank of America (NYSE:BAC): -7.3% Chevron Corp (NYSE:CVX): -5.3%\n\nThe Berkshire Hathaway portfolio includes positions in many stocks and one of the top performers year-to-date and over the last several years is Chinese automaker BYD CompanyADR (OTC:BYDDY).\n\nThe stock is up 49.1% year-to-date, up 69.3% over the last year and up 733.9% over the past five years. Along with beating Apple year-to-date, the five-year returns of the electric vehicle company also outpace Apple.\n\nBuffett currently owns over 54 million shares of BYD valued at $2.7 billion. The stock represents around 1% of the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio with the conglomerate owning over 4% of the automaker.\n\nWhile Buffett has trimmed the position in BYD in recent years, he remains a key shareholder and the stock's gains are helping Berkshire Hathaway and the wealth of Buffett.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway stock is up 19.3% year-to-date, outpacing the -3.0% performance of the SPY. Berkshire Hathaway has also outperformed the SPY on a one-year and five-year basis.\n\nBuffett is now the sixth richest person in the world with a wealth of $166 billion, according to Bloomberg. Buffett has gained $23.6 billion in wealth and is the top gainer year-to-date among the world's billionaires.\n\nOnly three of the top 10 richest people in the world have added to their wealth in 2025, with six of the top 10 each losing $20 billion or more to their wealth totals.\n\nStory Continues\n\nSee Also: The secret weapon in billionaire investor portfolios that you almost certainly don't own yet. See which asset class has outpaced the S&P 500 (1995-2024) \u2013 and with near-zero correlation.\n\nWhy It's Important: Buffett can thank companies like BYD that have gained in the Berkshire Hathaway stock portfolio for his increased wealth in 2025.\n\nThe growth may not be done for BYD as the company continues to expand in Europe and parts of Asia and is among the world's leaders in electric vehicle sales.\n\nIn March, BYD was number one in new electric vehicles sales in China, with 29.3% market share, outpacing Geely (11.2%) and Tesla (7.5%). In the first quarter of 2025, BYD had 28.8% market share for new electric vehicle sales in China.\n\nA new production facility in Hungary is expected to produce 200,000 units a year and help BYD's expansion in Europe. The company is also considering another factory in the region, according to reports.\n\nBYD sold 37,000 units in Europe in the first quarter of 2025, up from 8,500 units in the previous year.\n\nIn Japan and Australia, BYD is launching more affordable models that could help expand its market share.\n\nFuture growth for BYD and continued stock gains could be important to Berkshire Hathaway continuing to outperform the S&P 500 and for Buffett to grow his wealth.\n\nRead Next:\n\nIf there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?
